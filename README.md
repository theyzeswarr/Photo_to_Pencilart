# Image to Pencil Drawing Converter

This Python project allows you to convert a picture image into a pencil drawing using simple image processing techniques.

## Features

- Converts an input image into a pencil drawing.
- Applies a grayscale effect and simulates pencil-like strokes.
- Saves the pencil drawing image for further use.

## Prerequisites


- Using Visual studio Code
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- `OpenCV` library installed (`opencv-python` package).

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install `OpenCV` by running the command `pip install opencv-python`.

3. Place the image file you want to convert into the project directory. Ensure the image file is in a compatible format such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP.

4. Open the `convert_to_pencil_drawing.py` file in a text editor and replace the value of the `input_image_path` variable with the path or filename of your input image.

5. Run the following command to execute the script:
6. The script will process the input image and generate a pencil drawing version of it.

7. The resulting pencil drawing image will be saved as `pencil_drawing.jpg` in the project directory.

## Customization

- You can experiment with different parameters and techniques in the code to achieve different artistic effects.
- Additional image processing operations can be applied to enhance the pencil drawing effect.

## Dependencies

This project has the following dependency:

- `OpenCV`: Used for image loading, manipulation, and saving.



## Acknowledgments

- The project is inspired by various image processing techniques and pencil drawing algorithms.
- Thanks to the developers of the `OpenCV` library for providing a powerful and versatile tool for image processing.
